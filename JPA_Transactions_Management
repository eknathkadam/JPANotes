There are two types of PersistenceContexts

One managed by container - typically in a Jakarta EE type application
In Java SE application, the PeristenceContext is managed by the application.

Similarly - transactions are also managed by container or the application depending upon the type of the application.


Diference between	Transaction Synchronization, 
			Transaction Association
			Transaction Propagation


JAKARTA TRANSACTIONS TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT
Synchronization is with Persistence Context. When a transaction is commited the Persistence Context should know about it.
The provider of transaction sends a notification so that Persistence Context can be flushed to the database.

The attaching/assigning process of transaction to a persistence context is called Transaction Association

Transaction propagation is the process of sharing a persistence context between multiple container-managed entity managers in a single transaction.

There can be only one persistence context association with and propagated across a Jakarta Transactions transaction. All container managed entity managers in the same transaction must share the same prpagated persistence context.
